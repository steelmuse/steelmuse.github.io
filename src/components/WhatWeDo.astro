      Steel Muse helps entrepreneurs and inventors transform their ideas into
      successful, patent-protected businesses that last. That means more than
      advice. It means building the robust systems great ideas need to survive
      and thrive:

      We believe in transparency, not blind trust. We've developed a unified
      system connecting invention, IP, and venture creation. It uses a
      combination of algorithmic constraints and generative AI to build
      reliable, adaptable systems that explain how they work. They turn great
      ideas into enduring institutions.
