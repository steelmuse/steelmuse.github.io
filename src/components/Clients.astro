  <h2>Our Clients</h2>
  <p>We don’t talk about our clients or their innovations, unless they ask us to.</p> <blockquote>Confidentiality isn’t a clause. It’s a system-level safeguard.</blockquote>
<p>Every engagement runs inside governed infrastructure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No data is shared across clients </li>
    <li>No work is used for training</li>
    <li> All institutional memory is client-specific, role-specific, and under strict control</li>
  </ul>
<p>If you're a client and want to share what we’ve built together, just let us know.</p>
<strong>We’ll help you tell the story, on your terms.</strong></p>
